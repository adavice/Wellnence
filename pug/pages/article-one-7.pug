              h3.article__big-title 5 Wellness Trends You'll See In 2019
              p Everything you need to know this year about the top trends making waves in beauty, health and fitness. Read on to get your dose of the biggest 
                | moves in beauty — from crystals to heal your skin, to feminine care for the modern woman.
              h3.article__big-title All-In-One Wellness
              p As our lives get more connected, it is becoming easier to have the world at our fingertips — quite literally. The downside of it? It is virtually (pun 
                | very much intended) impossible to fully disconnect. This means that we are also constantly looking at ways to destress and recalibrate ourselves.
                | And the best kind of place to do so? All-in-one wellness spots that offer multiple solutions to all your health, wellness and beauty needs. From 
                | aesthetic clinics that go beyond providing high-tech treatments to also offering pampering facials and massages, you'll also be seeing more 
                | spots like COMO Shambhala's Urban Escape in Singapore. With a wide array of fitness, wellness and beauty classes and treatments available, 
                | you will have access to everything from yoga, pilates, naturopathy, massage therapy as well as alternative healing.
              h3.article__big-title Crystal-Infused Skincare
              p Taking crystal healing to a whole new level, 2019 is the year you'll be seeing a lot more crystal-infused skincare products. While much has been 
                | said about the vibrational energy of crystals, there are still many people who doubt their ability to eliminate negativity and promote a sense of 
                | well-being. It all this sounds a little too new-age for you, fret not. The truth is, crystal-infused skincare products are made with ultra-fine crystal 
                | particles, which essentially consist of minerals that carry tiny electrical charges. 
              p When mixed into skincare and applied on the skin, they can energise sluggish cellular activity, calm inflammation and improve circulation. For 
                | example, Nazan Schnapp's Sublime Hydrating Treatment Essence is a rose quartz-infused toner that locks in hydration, soothes skin and infuses 
                | it with antioxidants. Herbivore Botanicals' Crushed Amethyst Exfoliating Body Polish combines finely ground gemstone with organic virgin 
                | coconut oil and jasmine oil to smooth, brighten, nourish and perfume your skin.
              h3.article__big-title Feminine Care
              p Move over, Brazilian wax! Projected to grow at more than seven percent for the next several years, the feminine care industry is being given a 
                | new lease of life as more women become better educated and more interested in feminine care. Gone are the days where feminine grooming 
                | was limited to hair removal via getting waxed or IPL. Beyond products that help reduce ingrown hair or to soothe post-wax skin, today's vaginal 
                | and vulva care seem to entail so much more, spanning fancy vaginal cleansers, brightening cleansers to even detoxifying masks. Moreover, 
                | feminine hygiene products like sanitary pads are a major source of waste and as consumers become more conscious of the environmental 
                | impacts of their actions, there's been growing interest in menstrual cups and innovations like absorbent underwear.
              h3.article__big-title Plant-Based Meat
              p As more people become concerned with sustainability, it's only natural that companies are finding ways to reduce our carbon footprint by 
                | reducing the amount of beef we consume. After all, cattle is one of the most environmentally unfriendly livestock to rear. Which explains why 
                | there's been a growing interest in meat substitutes that are completely plant-based. For example, Beyond Meat makes Beyond Burger and 
                | Beyond Sausage, which look, cook and taste like real meat. With Bill Gates as one of its backers, Beyond Meat now retails at supermarkets 
                | across America and is also available at major hotels like Grand Hyatt Singapore. Another plant-based meat that is slated to be available in 
                | Singapore some time this year is Temasek-backed Impossible Foods.
              h3.article__big-title Continued Growth Of Sustainable Beauty
              p In line with the overall increase in sustainability, brands are adapting in more ways than ever. For example, L'Oreal is working towards reducing 
                | its water use in the production of its products; while LVMH's Dior plans to reduce its water use and carbon footprint by reducing product 
                | packaging and switching to energy-saving fixtures at points of retail as well as maximising shipping (smaller packaging means each shipment 
                | carries more products). In addition, more beauty brands are eliminating water altogether from their products. Besides being more 
                | environmentally friendly, waterless products are less likely to harbour bacteria and can last longer without the use of preservatives.

            .article__big-info
              p If you’re reading Greatist, chances are you’re not the type to jump on trends just because a celebrity mentioned it casually on their Insta stories. 
                | You do your homework! But it’s OK to be curious just because everyone’s talking about the latest miracle cures and life-changing wellness 
                | philosophies doesn’t mean they’re wrong. We’ve watched many fads come and go and waited to see which seemed like they were sticking 
                | around for 2019. Here are the home remedies, gadgets, lotions, potions, and movements we think might actually work, the ones we’re not 
                | quite sure about, and the ones that are probably BS but still have curious staying power.
              p The popularity of Peloton has ushered in competitors in the $14 billion home fitness equipment market. There are now smart rowing machines, 
                | weight lifting systems, boxing gloves, even jump ropes. Peloton, meanwhile, recently announced it was expanding into yoga, in addition to rolling 
                | out new treadmills. So, will Americans soon ditch the gym for their living room?
              p A new report from user insights platform Alpha found that 54% of Americans who work out at least once a month are interested in buying an 
                | at-home fitness system. But there were a few issues that held them back, namely “no room in their home or apartment” (34%), high cost (24%), 
                | and preference for the live class environment (11%). Prices will continue to drop as tech advances, more people buy, and the size issue is one 
                | the burgeoning industry is keeping in mind. A startup called Mirror reclaims living spaces with a $1,495 full-length connected device that comes 
                | alive with an LCD panel, stereo speakers, camera, and mic offering a range of one-on-one fitness classes. It’s essentially a virtual personal trainer 
                | the size of a yoga mat that turns back into a mirror when you’re done. “Right now, this tech is very early in the adoption cycle, and it may never 
                | make sense for everyone,” explains Alpha cofounder Nis Frome, “but for early adopters, the enthusiasm is pretty next-level, so the tech looks 
                | promising.”
              p Impossible Foods (which produces the “bleeding” Impossible Burgers) will soon churn out 500,000 pounds of plant-based “meat” each month to 
                | satisfy demand from the 3,000-plus restaurants it supplies. Beyond Meat, meanwhile, recently opened a 26,000-square-foot food lab dedicated 
                | to re-creating everything from your favorite ballpark franks all the way to steak. Today, plant-based sales account for 20% of food and beverage 
                | dollars spent by Americans, with beef alternatives making up 44% of that. In fact, a recent survey found that most Americans are even willing to 
                | give lab-grown meat a try. It’s a new era for plant-based alternatives, and startups are thinking way beyond standard products (burgers), 
                | audiences (vegans), or accessibility (supermarket aisles). “Eerily convincing” faux eggs are already here, so don’t be surprised if you soon hear 
                | about the world’s first plant-based oyster shack—or a meatless steakhouse. Good Catch, for example, released shelf-stable “tuna” made from 
                | lentils, chickpeas, and fava beans. The startup plans to deliver a range of products that reduce the environmental pressure brought about by 
                | overfishing. It joins similar companies such as Wild Type, which is attempting lab-grown salmon, and New Wave Foods, a shrimp alternative 
                | made from algae. Brick and mortar is also seeing a plant-based revolution. Monty’s Good Burger—which won over fans at music festivals like 
                | Coachella—just opened a permanent outpost in Los Angeles. Everything on the menu is vegan, including the vanilla milkshakes. On a sweltering 
                | summer afternoon, dozens of fans waited over an hour for the vegan creation dubbed the “In-N-Out of Impossible Burgers.” “I don’t know when 
                | we’ll get into something like octopus, but our plan is to slowly but surely address as much [seafood] as we can,” Good Catch cofounder Chris Kerr 
                | told Fast Company. “We are in this for the long haul.”

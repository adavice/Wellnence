                  how the models we tested for hundreds of hours stacked up against each other. Keep reading this article for tips and considerations for making

                <h3 class="article__big-title">Length and Style</h3>
                <p>The first consideration you need to make when selecting a pair is what length and style are best for you and the type of yoga you practice. No one wants their poses impeded by their clothing, nor do they want to wear something that is unflattering or uncomfortable.</p>
                <h3 class="article__big-title">Full Length vs. Capri</h3>
                <p>
                  We tested a variety of full length and capri models in this review. Capris end somewhere below the knee to mid-calf, or around a 19-20 inch inseam. Whether you prefer to practice in a long pant vs. a capri or even a short is a matter of personal preference, as well as the climate you 
                  live in and the type of yoga you practice. Hot yoga practitioners often wear as little as possible in their heated studios, whereas you're not 
                  leaving your house in shorts or capris in the middle of winter in the Northeast. All of the capri models that we tested are available in a 
                  full-length legging.

                <h3 class="article__big-title">Straight or Flared leg vs. Leggings</h3>
                <p>
                  Some people think their legs look weird or short in leggings and prefer the look of straight cut or flared legs. Others prefer the feel of leggings during strenuous classes as there is less material flapping around. Others like to practice in leggings but wear flared legs when running errands 
                  or lounging around the house. While you've probably already made up your mind as to which way your preferences lie, we typically prefer to 
                  practice in a legging vs. a pant. Fashion trends are also making straight and boot cut options harder to find, should that be your preference. 
                  For our updated review we only tested one boot cut pant, and it reaffirmed our choice of leggings or capris for most yoga classes. When it 
                  comes to the type of practice you do, we do have some tips for buying the perfect pair to complement whichever style you prefer.

                <h3 class="article__big-title">Gentle Hatha or Yin</h3>
                <p>
                  If you prefer your yoga calm and gentle, then comfort and fit are your first priorities in a pair. Look for looser cuts, full-lengths, and soft materials (including cotton or cotton-blends). We liked the uber-soft Beyond Yoga Spacedye High-Waist or Beyond Yoga Caught in the Midi 
                  for this style of practice. When holding a pose like Pigeon Pose for upwards of five minutes, you want something that is not confining or 
                  constricting in thighs and hips.
                </p>
                <h3 class="article__big-title">Basic Yoga</h3>
                <p>
                  If you practice "Level 1" type classes with a variety of poses but nothing too challenging or difficult, then any leg design is likely fine. The Alo Goddess Ribbed Legging is a nice choice for those who prefer a legging style than a pant and you'll be at home choosing one of our Best Buy 
                  options, like the 90 Degree, which performs impeccibly, or the Hofi High Waisted, which won't break the bank.
                </p>
                <h3 class="article__big-title">Vinyasa, Ashtanga or Other Vigorous Styles</h3>
                <p>
                  When performing a dozen or more Sun Salutations and a vinyasa between every pose, you'll want a pair that is streamlined and breathable. Look for leggings that are lightweight and breathable, like the Alo Yoga Airbrush, 90 Degree by Reflex Powerflex, Prana Transform Capri, or 
                  Lululemon Wunder Under Crop III. The Lululemon Align II and Lululemon Train will also suit you well for this type of practice.
                </p>
                <h3 class="article__big-title">Hot Yoga</h3>
                <p>
                  If you like your yoga extra sweaty and hot, then you need to dress for success, and usually, less is more. Look for shorter capris or "booty" shorts that give your skin its maximum opportunity to breathe. Some of the models that we tested have short options, such as the Onzie Side 
                  String Short. If you prefer to stay a bit more covered during class, you'll be happy with the Onzie Capri, or the Lululemon Train, our Top Pick for 
                  Hot Yoga. They are so lightweight that you barely notice you're wearing them. The Teeki Hot Pant is an excellent choice for heated yoga and 
                  Pilates classes as well, though we often found ourselves pulling them up during class.

                <p>
                  As the popularity of yoga and the yoga apparel industry grows, it's easy to get caught up in the fashion aspect of the practice. Ultimately, yoga is about experiencing one's true self, regardless of what you have on, and achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Though it can't 
                  hurt to look OHMazing while doing so.
